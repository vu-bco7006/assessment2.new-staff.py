# Assessment 2

In the CSV file in this repository, you can find a number of staff members and their salaries. Compute the following and display on the screen:

1. The average salary of staff members whose employee type is "Manager"
1. The full name of the staff member who has the lowest salary

Your Python program file should be named ``staff.py``. Use Python's string formatting to produce an output that is similar to the sample below.

Organise your code appropriately with the features provided by Python. Hint: Go through the lecture slides we have seen so far and think about what can be used in this assessment.

Also, you will be marked with Git commits and branches so make sure you use them while writing your code.

## Sample output:
```
The average salary of managers is 72,750 dollars.
Paul Innit has the lowest salary ($41000.00).
```
